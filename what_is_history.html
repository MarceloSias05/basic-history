    <p class="paragraph">The definition of history is basically every event or action that happened
       in the past. The term comes from the word "Histor", in Greek, which means "witness" or "who saws", but it has many definitions.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">It has multiple divisions which include world history, national history, personal
       history, history of communities, and many others.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">‘Herodotus’ is considered the father of sciences, and therefore, of history.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">When experts apply the scientific method in the study of history, the historiography is made.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">In historiography, the history is studied as a science, using observation,
      theories, laws, and by different points of view.</p>
